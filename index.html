            The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest
            paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a
            weighted digraph.[1] It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the
            same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling
            graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers. The
            algorithm was first proposed by Alfonso Shimbel (1955), but is
            instead named after Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr., who
            published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively.[2] Edward F. Moore also
            published a variation of the algorithm in 1959, and for this reason
            it is also sometimes called the Bellman–Ford–Moore algorithm.[1]
            Negative edge weights are found in various applications of graphs,
            hence the usefulness of this algorithm.[3] If a graph contains a
            "negative cycle" (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value)
            that is reachable from the source, then there is no cheapest path:
            any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper
            by one more walk around the negative cycle. In such a case, the
            Bellman–Ford algorithm can detect and report the negative
            cycle.[1][4]
